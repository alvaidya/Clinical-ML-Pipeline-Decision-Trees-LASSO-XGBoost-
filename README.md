Clinical ML Pipeline: Decision Trees, LASSO & XGBoost

**Short description:**  
A compact, project demonstrating interpretable and regularized regression workflows: decision trees (with rule extraction & pruning), LASSO/Ridge, PCR (PCA + linear regression), and XGBoost — applied to a clinical (Acute Inflammations) dataset and the Communities & Crime dataset. Implements data cleaning, imputation, feature selection, model tuning (cross-validation/GridSearch), and visualization.
